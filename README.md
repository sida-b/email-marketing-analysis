# âœ‰ Email Marketing Analysis
## Introduction
I analyzed a fictitious email marketing dataset from Enterprise DNA. The dataset was an excel file with 2 sheets. One had data of sales, and which product each customer bought. The other sheet had data of emails sent to each customer and whether the customer received it, opened it, and clicked on the link in the email. The goal of this analysis was to discover the relationship between emails and sales. **I used Python with the libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for this analysis.**
