# âœ‰ Email Marketing Analysis
## Introduction
I analyzed a fictitious email marketing dataset from Enterprise DNA. The dataset was an excel file with 2 sheets. One had data of sales, and which product each customer bought. The other sheet had data of emails sent to each customer and whether the customer received it, opened it, and clicked on the link in the email. The goal of this analysis was to discover the relationship between emails and sales. **I used Python with the libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for this analysis.**

## Analysis
First, I checked the dataset for missing data and outliers. There were no missing values nor outliers, so I was able to start my analysis. I loaded the dataset into Jupyter Notebook and created 2 dataframes: one for sales and the other for emails. 

**Overview**

- I calculated the sum of the Sales Value column in the sales dataframe to get the total sales of $5,114,683.
- I counted the number of unique customers, which were 263 customers.
- I counted the rows in the sales dataframe, which were 10,000 sales order.
- I counted the number of unique products, which were 10 products.
